# NASOQ: Numerically Accurate Sparsity Oriented QP Solver

NASOQ is a scalable and efficient Quadratic Programming solver that 
obtains solutions for requested accuracies. Visit our website for more details: 
[NASOQ Website](https://nasoq.github.io/)




## Installation
### Library requirements
MKL Pardiso or OpenBlas (BLAS), OpenMP and METIS.
Cmake handles METIS.
If you install OpenBlas in its default location (sudo make install), Cmake will detect it.

METIS is a mandatory dependency in this branch. It can be installed by
```
sudo aptitude install libmetis-dev
```

### Building the project
Given that MKL Pardiso or OpenBlas  are installed, install NASOQ using
following steps:
```
mkdir build
cd build
cmake -DMKL_ROOT_PATH=path/to/intel  -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release ..
cmake ..
```
If you install Intel MKL via apt, `path/to/intel` is `/opt/intel`.

A quick script for building and running NASOQ is provided in `buildALL.sh`. 
You need to first correct paths to libraries and then you can run it as following:
```bash
bash buildAll.sh
```
Upon successful build you should be able to see `data/out.csv` and 
it should be similar to `data/out_correct.csv`.  

For installing on MAc you might need to use GCC so you need to also set the CMAKE compiler flag.

### Using NASOQ as a Library
More details: https://nasoq.github.io/docs/getting-started-nasoq/


### Testing a QP example
To test a QP example you may also use `NASOQ-BIN` which is a command line interfce for NASOQ.
Some small QP problems are available in `data` folder.
For evaluating NASOQ versus other solvers a separate repository is also provided in:
https://github.com/sympiler/nasoq-benchmarks
